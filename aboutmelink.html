   <h1><b>Get to know more about me!</b></h1>
 
   <p> Hi! I'm Rachel and am currently a rising senior at Chantilly High School. <br>
       I've created this website so that those that visit it are able to get to know a <br>
       little bit more about me and the work that I've created over the past several years. <br>
      During my summer before senior year, I have been dedicating majority of my time fully <br> 
      immersing myself into being an active learner in the field of computer science; I am currently <br> 
      a student in the Girsl Who Code Summer Immersion Program.  
       As a student, I've gotten asked <br> mulitple of times what I wanted to do as a career and I've <br>
      always answered saying I was interested in both science and the fine arts so a career path that <br>
      grants my interest was always my dream. I never had a good idea of what specific career would <br>
      match my interests until I started learning more about computer science and coding. I've finally <br> 
      reaized that computer science was indeed that answer to all my questions. It is a field in which <br> 
      I am able to meet my needs for a creative outlet but it also is a field in which I'm able to <br> 
      strategically problem solve and collabortively work with others. <br>
       In my free time, you'll most likely find me working on new art projects, coloring in adult <br> coloring books, or googling randome qustions that I'm itching to get answered! </p>
