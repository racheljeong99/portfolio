  <h1>Get to know more about me!</h1>
  
  <br>
 
   <p> Hi! I'm Rachel and am currently a rising senior at Chantilly High School. 
      I've created this website so that those that visit it are able to get to know a little bit more about me and the work that I've created over the past several years. During my summer before senior year, I have been dedicating majority of my time fully immersing myself into being an active learner in the field of computer science; I am currently a student in the Girsl Who Code Summer Immersion Program.  
      As a student, I've gotten asked mulitple of times what I wanted to do as a career and I've always answered saying I was interested in both science and the fine arts so a career path that grants my interest was always my dream. I never had a good idea of what specific career would match my interests until I started learning more about computer science and coding. I've finally reaized that computer science was indeed that answer to all my questions. It is a field in which I am able to meet my needs for a creative outlet but it also is a field in which I'm able to strategically problem solve and collabortively work with others. 
      In my free time, you'll most likely find me working on new art projects, coloring in adult coloring books, or googling randome qustions that I'm itching to get answered! </p>
